Hi everyone.....
The code explains how to calculate sentiment polarity on twitter extracted data and a smaller portion of EDA on the given dataset.
And after that i have done topic modelling on the dataset.
The dataset i have chosen was twitter extracted data regerding hashtag on "Donald Trump".
The data has taken through API keys which they provides only after creating twitter developer account, and have saved the data to csv file.
This csv dataset is chosen to calculate sentiment polarity and then to do topic modelling.
